#  Demonstration of VersionWidget()

The VersionWidget() is demonstrated comparing version number against a
number of github repositories, and reporting if the version number
specified through the call is up to date according to the github
CHANGELOG or is out of date.

Simply build and run the example app:

```
flutter run
```
